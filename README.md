# Low SNR Digital modulation CNN classifier
This project is the final project of Ido Avrahami and Yarin Killim Nagar.

This project presents developed a Digital Communication 
Modulations Classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network, 
designed to perform effectively even with low Signal-to-Noise 
Ratio (SNR) modulations.

## Features
- Train: Function to train the modulation recognition model.
- modgenerator, modgeneratoronlylabels, FinalDatabaseGenerator2nd: Functions to create modulated signals based on specified modulations, order, and SNR.
- func_denoise_dw2d: Function to denoise signals using wavelet transform in the pre-processing stage.
